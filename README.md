# Two-Wheeler-Rental-System

This project focuses on developing a vehicle booking system to enhance the user experience by streamlining the registration, login, vehicle selection, and booking processes. My goal was to create a seamless journey from account creation to vehicle booking confirmation, ensuring efficiency and satisfaction for the user at every step.

The system comprises several interconnected modules, each designed to play a crucial role in the overall workflow. These modules include user registration, user login, vehicle listing, vehicle booking, and booking confirmation. I've meticulously crafted each component with the user experience in mind, utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL to build a responsive and interactive platform
